Submission for the Decode Demcon minesweeper challenge.

The "main.py" file specifies the grid and invokes the solver.

I already work at Demcon (Best) in Multiphysics and would like some feedback on my coding practice if you have any.
I do know that the magical constants aren't pretty, but it's convenient to have the number of adjacent mines in numerical format so the other values and arrays followed.
It's a shame that Python doesn't have sum types (as far as I'm aware).
